 ## Rule changes
 Some changes were made to the rules of chess (for now, at least).
 - Being in check does not prevent other moves
 - The king can walk into check
 - There is no checkmate concept, the king must actually be captured to win
 - Castling through attacked fields is allowed
 - Pawns always promote to queen
